My name is data.
I like coding.
The languages i code in are mostly C# and lua (when i embed it into my programs)
I'm very interested with how languages work and make some as a hobby, I even created my own lang in cpp but it never finished it, I mostly make VR games but i haven't published a title yet lol.
