# About me
My name is data.

I like coding and under that umbrella i like game dev, engine dev and lang dev, those are my hobbies.

I used to code mostly in C# but nowadays i mostly code in luau (I love embedding luau into engines and stuff) and cpp, i like language development and i've actually made an lang called [meow](https://github.com/KinexDev/Meow) in my freetime though it is unfinished, i love making game engines too!

I know most common engines like Unity, Unreal (limited experience with because of how unbelievably slow it is!), Godot etc but i don't use them since they are too slow nowadays except for godot, but i just don't like it in general.

I hate web development!
