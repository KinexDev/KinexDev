My name is data.

I like coding and game dev, those are my hobbies.

The languages i code in are mostly C# and lua and other high-level languages

I like programming, i mostly program in C# (.NET)

I know most common engines like Unity, Godot and flax etc, i'm currently learning unreal in my spare time.

I'm currently making my own game Cat Mania!

I love messing around with lua and it's dialects.
